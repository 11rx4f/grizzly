## Goals of the Eclipse Grizzly Framework

Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming language
has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API
(NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to scale
to thousands of users. The Eclipse Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to
help developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API.

The Grizzly framework was originally developed as part of Java EE.
This project was contributed by Oracle Corporation to The Eclipse Foundation where it now
evolves under Eclipse Grizzly. You can see latest project information at
the [EE4J Eclipse Grizzly Page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.grizzly).

Our hope is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers
using NIO and we are also offering extended framework components such
as:

-   HTTP Protocol framework for creating custom HTTP applications

-   HTTP Server framework which offers high level abstractions to the
    HTTP protocol (not unlike Servlets)

## System Requirements

The system requirements for Grizzly 2.3 are quite simple.
Basically, Grizzly is able to run on any platform that [JDK
1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) is available on.

## Source code

Grizzly source may be viewed online on the GitHub git
[repository](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/grizzly).

## Where to Get Help

You can reach the Eclipse Grizzly committer team via their developer team [e-mail list](mailto:grizzly-dev@eclipse.org). You may subscribe to this list and view the archives via [this web-form](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/grizzly-dev).

The best resource is the [project issue
tracker](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/grizzly/issues). If you find a bug with
Grizzly, or have recommendations on how to improve Grizzly, this is the
place to do it.
